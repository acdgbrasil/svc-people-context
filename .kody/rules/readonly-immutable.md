## Instructions

Immutability by default. All interface properties and object types must use `readonly`.

Flag:
- Interface properties without `readonly`
- Type alias object properties without `readonly`
- Use of `let` where `const` would suffice
- Mutable array operations (`push`, `splice`) when spread/concat would work

Allowed:
- Loop variables (`for (let i = ...`)
- Reassignment in reducer patterns
- External library types that don't use readonly

## Examples

### Bad example
```typescript
interface Person {
  id: string;        // Missing readonly
  name: string;
  roles: string[];
}
```

### Good example
```typescript
interface Person {
  readonly id: string;
  readonly name: string;
  readonly roles: readonly string[];
}
```
