## Instructions

`any` bypasses TypeScript's type system entirely. Use `unknown` and narrow with type guards.

Flag:
- `any` type annotation (`: any`, `as any`, `<any>`)
- Type assertions that widen to `any` (`value as any`)
- Generic defaults to `any`

Allowed:
- External library type definitions that use `any` internally
- `catch (e)` where `e` is implicitly `unknown` in strict mode
